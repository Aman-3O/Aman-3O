Hello! Iâ€™m Aman Vishwakarma, a dedicated and passionate Computer Science Engineering student at Sushila Devi Bansal College of Technology, Indore.

With strong communication skills and fluency in English, I thrive in collaborative environments. I'm currently looking an internship or entry-level opportunity where I can grow as a Python Developer. My technical foundation includes Python, Java, C++ and React, but Python stands out as my preferred language especially for backend development and automation.

I bring a sense of responsibility and a growth mindset to everything I do. I'm always looking to learn from experienced professionals, and Iâ€™m currently upskilling through the Google IT Automation with Python certification.

Letâ€™s connect if you're looking for a self-driven team player eager to contribute to impactful tech projects. Iâ€™m excited about whatâ€™s ahead and open to opportunities that help shape the future of technology!
